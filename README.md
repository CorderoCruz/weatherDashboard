# weatherDashboard

This is for UCR's Coding Bootcamp Module 6 (Server Side API's)

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

This project allows you to to search for weather data depending on the city of your choosing

I struggled very much witht this project and I still am.
There are some concepts I still do not understand like setting the local storage and linking it to some buttons.

Some of the challenges I faced was converting the actual city name and converting that specific city name into GEO location i.e latitude and longitude
I was looping through the API data when I wasnt supposed to because I already came back ready to use without having to loop through the data.
